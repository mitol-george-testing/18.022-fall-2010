Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _18.022 Calculus of Several Variables_ as it was taught by Prof. James McKernan in Fall 2010.

This is a course in multivariable calculus, with more focus on mathematical concepts than [_18.02 Multivariable Calculus_](/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/).

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

The students will learn about vectors, dot products, cross products, how to describe lines and planes, functions of more than one variable, parameterizations of curves and surfaces, partial derivatives, iterated integrals, gradient, divergence and curl, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, and the divergence theorem.

Student Information
-------------------

![83 students took this course in Fall 2010.](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/18-022_stat-students)

### Enrollment

This course is significantly smaller than [18.02](/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/), which usually has close to 500 students.

### Breakdown by Year

This is intended mainly as a course for freshmen.

### Typical Student Background

*   Most MIT students will take [18.02](/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/), which emphasizes applications of calculus to the sciences (especially physics).
*   This course, 18.022, is geared to students who have a more theoretical interest in multivariable calculus, perhaps because they are interested in majoring in mathematics.
*   Some students may have seen calculus in high school and want to take a more challenging class.
